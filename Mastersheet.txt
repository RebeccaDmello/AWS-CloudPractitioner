Reserved Instances
- Convertible => Enables you to exchange one or more convertible reserved instances with diff confi including family, OS and tenancy 
- Zonal => Zonal RI apply to instance usage within a specific AZ within an AWS region
- Standard =>You can't change the Instance type but you can change the size
- Regional => Apply to instance usage within any AZ in a specified region

Hosting models
- Dedicated host => fully dedicated to your use, has VPC, SW licenses/servers, workload must be run on specific, physical server
- Reserved Hosts => provide significant discount, suitable app with Predictable usage
- On-demand host => 
- Spot Instances => Purchase speare computing capacity with no upfront commitment at discounted hourly rates, good for app with flexible start date

- Avoid long-term contracts => Pay as you go pricing
- Value proposition => Economies of Scale

Speed and Agility
- Scalable compute capacity and fast provisioning of resources

Cost allocation tags => tag your resources by department or project and then view costs attributed to the resources
AWS Trusted advisor => This service advises you on best practices for provisioning resources
Consolidated billing => Consolidated billing will give you usage per account but not per project


Health Dashboard => Shows issues or upcoming events that may impact your resources. It does not notify of service limit breaches
Amazon RDS => This is a managed SQL database and has nothing to do with service limits generally.
AWS Cost Explorer => Cost Explorer is used for viewing costs and will not assist with service limits.
Artifacts => security and compliance documents.
Quick Start => architecture and deployment instr

Usage
IAM => Making programmatic calls to aws from aws apis
Management console => Logging into the aws management console with user name and password
Creating encrypted channels using HTTPS => Enabling encryption in transit for web servers

CodeGuru => It is used to review code and provide intelligent recommendations for improvement
Config => compliance management
Cloud development kit (CDK) => Deploy infra on AWS using familiar programming languages
CodeCommit => CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service
CloudWatch => Monitoring
CloudTrail => It is used for auditing
AWS Trsuted Advisor => It is an online tool that provides you real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.
Trusted advisor checks help optimize your AWS infra, improve security and performance, reduce your overall costs and monitor service limits.
Inspector => Automated security service
Systems Manager => It is used for managing EC2 instances such as installing patches and software
Budget => Allows you to set custom budgets to track your cost and usage for all use cases
Organizations => organize multiple aws accounts

CodeBuild => Compiling and testing code ahead of deployment
Cost Explorer => View itemized costs but you cannot check resource utilization
Inspector => Automated security assessment service that help improve the security and compliance of apps deployed on AWS.
CloudFront => Content delivery network improve customer experience by reducing latency, deploy infra from templates
Elastic File System (EFS) => Used for storing data and is mounted by EC2 instances
Inspector => Inspector is an automated security assessment service that help improve the security and compliance of app deployed on AWS.
EC2 auto scaling => It launches and terminates instances and it does not reduce latency for global users.

Scheduled scaling => Allows to scale schedule according to predictable load changes
Predictive scaling => It uses daily and weekly trends to determine when to scale.
Target tracking scaling policy => This policy will cause the ASG to attempt to keep resources utilization at the target value
Step scaling => Step scaling will launch resources in response to demand, this will not ensure the resource are ready at the right time as there will be a delay.

Examples of pillar of the AWS Well-Archi framework
- Reliability => RDS multi-AZ deployment
- Performance efficiency =>EBS provisioned IOPS volume
- Security => WebACL to a cloudFront distribution
- Operational excellence => Use CloudFormation to deploy infra (anticipate failure, perform operations as code)

AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) => Protecting a website that is hosted outside of AWS
EC2 security grps => Security groups can only be attached to EC2 instances
Network ACL => Only filter traffic entering and leaving a VPC subnet

CodeDeploy => Deploying code from a repository and actually installing the app
Software Development Kit => Integrate features of aws services directly into the app
Command Line Interface (CLI) => It is used for running commands.
CodePipeline => Automating the code release lifecycle
AWS DataSync => It is used for replication and migrating data between storage systems and AWS

SNS => publisher/subscriber notification service that uses a push mechanism
SQS => message queue service used for decoupling apps
SWF => Simple workflow service is a workflow orchestration service, not a messaging service
Step functions => AWS step functions is a serverless workflow orchestration service for modern apps

Databases
Athena => It is used for querying data in S3 using SQL
DocumentDB => DocumentDB is a NoSQL database that supports document data structures
EC2 => Need full control over instance and database, third-party database engine
RDS => Traditional relational database, oracle, postgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, MariaDB, MySQL, Data is well-formed and structured (Simplies database administration task)
DynamoDB => NoSQL database, in-memory performance, high I/O needs, Dynamic scaling
Redshift => Data warehouse for analytics
ElastiCache => Fast temporary storage for small amounts of data, in-memory database, caching. It is a database caching service, it is not used to cache websites
EMR => Analytics workloads using Hadoop framework
AMI => preconfigured amazon elastic compute instance, provides into required to launch an instance including mapping of EBS volumes
EFS => Elastic File system can be mounted to store data
EBS => Elastic block store is block-based storage for EC2, root storage volumes for amazon EC2 instances
EC2 systems manager => AWS systems manager gives you visibility and control of your infra on AWS
AppStream 2.0 => Fully managed non-persistent app and desktop streaming service
S3 => It is a service that is accessed via a REST API
Amazon Macie => Discover and protect sensitive data that is stored in S3 buckets
GuardDuty => Threat detection service to continuously monitor malicious activities and unauthorized behavior to protect aws accounts, workloads and data stores
Policy generator => Tool to create policies that control access to aws products and resources
Detective => Automatically processes terabytes of events data records about IP traffic, management operations and malicious/unauthorized activity
Data pipeline => It is a web service that helps you reliably process and move data between different compute and storage services.
