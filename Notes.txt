- Compute networking and content delivery
- Storage
- Database
- Security, identity and compliance
- Management and governance

4. Services

4. Amazon simple notification service -messages are published to topics
5. Amazon simple queue service - send/store and receive message
5. AWS Lambda - Run code without provisioning or managing servers, Pay only for compute time while code is running
