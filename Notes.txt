1. Cloud Computing (Pay for only what you use, Capacity and allocate resources as needed)
- Access services on demand, avoid large upfront investments, provision computing resources as needed, pay for only what you use

2. Cloud Computing benefits 
- Variable expenses
- Capacity
- Economies of scale (Pay higher prices based on only your own usage, Benefit from customers aggregated usage)
- Speed and agility (Minutes between wanting resources and having resources)
- Global in minutes (Quickly deploy apps worldwide, AWS global infra)

3. Core services
- Compute networking and content delivery
- Storage
- Database
- Security, identity and compliance
- Management and governance

4. Services
1. EC2 -> connect/launch instance, Auto scaling, balance compute/ compute-intensive apps, batch processing workloads, compute-intensive workloads
2. AMI -> Amazon machine image
3. Elastic Load balancing service - automatically distributes traffic across multiple resources
4. Amazon simple notification service -messages are published to topics
5. Amazon simple queue service - send/store and receive message
5. AWS Lambda - Run code without provisioning or managing servers, Pay only for compute time while code is running
6. AWS container orchestration services - a. ECS (Run and scale containerized apps) b. EKS (Run and scale kubernetes apps) c. AWS Fargate (Run serverless containers with Amazon ECS or EKS)
7. Cloud front - global content delivery service, Using a network of edge locations to cache and delivery to customers


Regions and Availability Zones
- VERY REGION HAS MIN OF 3 AZ, AZ ARE 10S OF MILES APART
- Points of presence used by content delivery network, Point of presence is also known as edge location
- Edge locations have caches that store temp data that will be used for customer request data
- Selecting a region ~ Compliance with data governance and legal requirements, Proximity to customers, Available services within a region, Pricing

INTERACTING WITH AWS SERVICES
- AWS MANAGEMENT CONSOLE, AWS CLI, SDKs

NETWORKING (Subnets, VPC and Direct connect)
1 Amazon VPC - Amazon virtual private cloud enables you to launch resources in a virtual network that you define.
2 Subnet - A subnet is a section in a VPC in which you can place groups of isolated resources which can be either public or private, Subnets can communicate together within a VPC.
3 AWS Direct Connect - Establish a dedicated connection between an on-premises data center and the VPC
