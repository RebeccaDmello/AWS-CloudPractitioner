1. AWS Analytics Services
~ Athena (Query RDS), EMR (Data processing), GLUE(ETL service) and Kinesis (real-time data)
~ Athena => Interactive query service that makes easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL
~ EMR => Elastic Map Reduce, uses hadoop for processing huge amount of data. 
~ GLUE => runs the ETL jobs on a fully managed, scale-out Apache Spark env to load your data into its destination
~ Kinesis => Makes it easy to collect, process and analyze real-time streaming data. categories - Data streams, Data Firehose, Data Analytics, 

2. Monitoring and Logging services
~ Amazon CloudWatch(Monitoring - billing & resource) => Collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files and set alarms, auto react to changes in your AWS resources like EC2 instances, DynamoDB, RDS DB instances, custom metrics and log files. Uses SNS for sending email
~ Amazon CloudTrail(Auditing - API records) => Records activity made on your account and delivers log files to an S3 bucket, Logging and saving history of API calls for your AWS account

3. AWS Content Delivery and DNS Services
~ Amazon Route 53(Domain registration) => performs 3 main function of Domain registration, Domain Name Service - translate IP address to global recognized name and Health Checking-sends automated requests to your app to verify that it's reachable, available and functional
~ CloudFront (Content/Data delivery at Edge caches/locations) => It is a content delivery network that allows you to store content at edge location. Allows customers to access content(Videos,APIs) more quickly and provides security against DDoS attacks.

4. AWS Cloud Computing Concepts
~ CC is an on-demand delivery of compute, storage, network and serverless
~ Cloud Computing Models - IaaS(high level of flexibility and control over IT resources), 
PaaS(focus more on deployment and management of your app), SaaS(focuses more on using the software)
~Type of cloud: Public, Hybrid and Private
Public - Eg AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP
Hybrid - a mixture of public and private clouds
Private - a cloud managed in your own data center eg. Hyper-V, OpenStack, VMWare

5. AWS Storage
~ S3 => S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Uses of S3 are backup and storage, App hosting, Media Hosting, Software Delivery and static website. When you successfully upload a file to S3 you receive a HTTP 200 code.
Storage Type
a. Persistent Data Store => Data is durable and sticks around after reboots, restarts or power cycles. Ex - S3, Glacier, EBS, EFS
b. Transient Data store => Data is just temporarily stored and passed along to another process or persistent store. Ex. SQS, SNS
c. Ephemeral Data store (non-persistent) => Data is lost when the system is stopped. Ex. EC2 Instance Store, Memcached

~ AWS Snowball => You can transfer hundreds of terabytes or perabytes of data between your on-premises data centers and S3. Snowball client is software that is installed on a local computer and is used to identify, compress, encrypt and transfer data. 

~ Elastic Block Store => Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block stoarge volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.
Each EBS is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect from component failure, offering high availability and durability.

~ Elastic File System (EFS) =>  EFS uses the NFS protocol which is Pay for what you use(no pre-provisioning required). It can scale upto petabytes. Elastic which can grown and shrink whenever needed.
