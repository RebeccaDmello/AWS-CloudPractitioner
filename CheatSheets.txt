4. AWS Cloud Computing Concepts
~ CC is an on-demand delivery of compute, storage, network and serverless
~ Cloud Computing Models - IaaS(high level of flexibility and control over IT resources), 
PaaS(focus more on deployment and management of your app), SaaS(focuses more on using the software)
~Type of cloud: Public, Hybrid and Private
Public - Eg AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP
Hybrid - a mixture of public and private clouds
Private - a cloud managed in your own data center eg. Hyper-V, OpenStack, VMWare

5. AWS Storage
~ S3 => S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Uses of S3 are backup and storage, App hosting, Media Hosting, Software Delivery and static website. When you successfully upload a file to S3 you receive a HTTP 200 code.
Storage Type
a. Persistent Data Store => Data is durable and sticks around after reboots, restarts or power cycles. Ex - S3, Glacier, EBS, EFS
b. Transient Data store => Data is just temporarily stored and passed along to another process or persistent store. Ex. SQS, SNS
c. Ephemeral Data store (non-persistent) => Data is lost when the system is stopped. Ex. EC2 Instance Store, Memcached

~ AWS Snowball => You can transfer hundreds of terabytes or perabytes of data between your on-premises data centers and S3. Snowball client is software that is installed on a local computer and is used to identify, compress, encrypt and transfer data. 

~ Elastic Block Store => Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block stoarge volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.
Each EBS is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect from component failure, offering high availability and durability.

~ Elastic File System (EFS) =>  EFS uses the NFS protocol which is Pay for what you use(no pre-provisioning required). It can scale upto petabytes. Elastic which can grown and shrink whenever needed.

6. AWS Shared Responsibility Model (Security + Compliance) Which security is AWS responsible and which is of customer/user

Outposts is available as a 42U rack that can scale from 1 rack to 96 racks to create pools of compute and storage capacity
Outposts is ideal for workloads that require low latency access to on-premises systems, local data processing, data residency and migration of apps with local system interdependencies.

9. Identity and Access management (authorized signin-signout)
~ AWS Identity and access management is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources
~ IAM can be use to manage users, groups, access policies, roles, user crendentials, user password policies, multi-factor authentication, API keys for programmatic access
~ IAM Users => An IAM user is an entity that represents a person or service who has been granted access to the service
~ Groups => Groups are collections of users and have policies attached to them. A group is not an identity and cannot be identified as a principal in an IAM policy.
~ Roles => Roles are set of permissions for making AWS service requests
~ Policies => Policies are documents that define permissions and can be applied to users, groups and roles
~ STS => Security token service is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for IAM users or for users that you authenticate

10. Global Infra (IMPORTANT)
~ Regions 26 => AWS Region is a physical geographical location which can consists of 2 or more availability zones and data centers.
~ Availability Zones 84 => AZs consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity. AZs are designed as independent failure zone.
~ Local Zones 17 => Local zones place compute, storage, database and other AWS services closer to end-users. AWS local zones, you can easily run highly demanding apps that require single-digit millisecond latencies to your end-users.
~ AWS Wavelength 24 => Wavelength enables developers to build apps that deliver single-digit millisecond latencies to mobile devices and end-users
~ AWS Outposts => Outposts bring native AWS services, infra and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space or on-premises facility.

~ RDS (SQL database, Relational, OLTP) => relational database for OLTP, data is well-formed and structured, online store and banking systems, Used to perform complex queries and joins. RDS can scale vertically. RDS supports foll database engines: SQL server, Oracle, MySQL server, PostgreSQL, Aurora, MariaDB.
~ DynamoDB (NoSQL database) => Unpredictable data structure, in-memory performance with persistence, require dynamic scaling. NoSQL scales horizontally.
DynamoDB synchronously replictes data across three facilities in an AWS region for fault tolerance.
~ Redshift (relational, OLAP, ANALYTICS apps) => Redshift is a SQL based data warehouse used for analytics applications, It is used for OLAP (Online Analytics Processing) use cases. Redshift is a managed data warehouse service that is designed to operate at less than a tenth the cost of traditional solutions.

15. AWS Elastic Load Balancing (Elasticity and high availability)
~ Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling => Automates the process of launching and terminating Amazon EC2 instances based on the traffic demand of your app
~ Amazon Elastic Load Balanacing (ELB) => automatically distributes incoming app traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers and IP addresses. Application Load balancer and network load balancer

16. Architecting for the cloud
~ Horizontal scaling => Add more instances as demand increases, No downtime required to scale up or down, automatic using services such as AWS Auto-scaling, unlimited scalability
~ Vertical scaling => Add more CPU and/or RAM to existing instances as demand increases, requires a restart to scale up or down, would require scripting or automation tools to automate, scalability limited by maximum instance size
~ Stateless apps => A stateless app is an app that needs no knowledge of previous interactions and stores no session info.
~ EC2 auto recovery => create an amazon cloudwatch alarm that monitors an EC2 instance and automatically recovers it if it becomes impaired
~ Auto scaling => With auto scaling, you can maintain app availability and scale your EC2 capacity up or down automatically to conditions you define
~ CloudWatch Alarms => Create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an SNS messgage when a particular metric goes beyond a specific threshold for a specified number of periods
~ CloudWatch Events => CloudWatch service delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources
~ OpsWorks Lifecycle events => OpsWorks support continuous confi through lifecycle events that automatically update your instances confi to adapt to event changes
~ Lambda schedules events => These events allow you to create a Lambda funct and direct AWS Lambda to execute it on a regular schedule
~ Loose coupling => IT system should be designed in a way that reduces interdependencies - a change or a failure in one componet should not cascade to other components
