1. AWS Analytics Services
~ Athena (Query RDS), EMR (Data processing), GLUE(ETL service) and Kinesis (real-time data)
~ Athena => Interactive query service that makes easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL
~ EMR => Elastic Map Reduce, uses hadoop for processing huge amount of data. 
~ GLUE => runs the ETL jobs on a fully managed, scale-out Apache Spark env to load your data into its destination
~ Kinesis => Makes it easy to collect, process and analyze real-time streaming data. categories - Data streams, Data Firehose, Data Analytics, 

2. Monitoring and Logging services
~ Amazon CloudWatch(Monitoring - billing & resource) => Collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files and set alarms, auto react to changes in your AWS resources like EC2 instances, DynamoDB, RDS DB instances, custom metrics and log files. Uses SNS for sending email
~ Amazon CloudTrail(Auditing - API records) => Records activity made on your account and delivers log files to an S3 bucket, Logging and saving history of API calls for your AWS account

3. AWS Content Delivery and DNS Services
~ Amazon Route 53(Domain registration) => performs 3 main function of Domain registration, Domain Name Service - translate IP address to global recognized name and Health Checking-sends automated requests to your app to verify that it's reachable, available and functional
~ CloudFront (Content/Data delivery at Edge caches/locations) => It is a content delivery network that allows you to store content at edge location. Allows customers to access content(Videos,APIs) more quickly and provides security against DDoS attacks.

4. AWS Cloud Computing Concepts
~ CC is an on-demand delivery of compute, storage, network and serverless
~ Cloud Computing Models - IaaS(high level of flexibility and control over IT resources), 
PaaS(focus more on deployment and management of your app), SaaS(focuses more on using the software)
~Type of cloud: Public, Hybrid and Private
Public - Eg AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP
Hybrid - a mixture of public and private clouds
Private - a cloud managed in your own data center eg. Hyper-V, OpenStack, VMWare

5. AWS Storage
~ S3 => S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Uses of S3 are backup and storage, App hosting, Media Hosting, Software Delivery and static website. When you successfully upload a file to S3 you receive a HTTP 200 code.
Storage Type
a. Persistent Data Store => Data is durable and sticks around after reboots, restarts or power cycles. Ex - S3, Glacier, EBS, EFS
b. Transient Data store => Data is just temporarily stored and passed along to another process or persistent store. Ex. SQS, SNS
c. Ephemeral Data store (non-persistent) => Data is lost when the system is stopped. Ex. EC2 Instance Store, Memcached

~ AWS Snowball => You can transfer hundreds of terabytes or perabytes of data between your on-premises data centers and S3. Snowball client is software that is installed on a local computer and is used to identify, compress, encrypt and transfer data. 

~ Elastic Block Store => Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block stoarge volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.
Each EBS is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect from component failure, offering high availability and durability.

~ Elastic File System (EFS) =>  EFS uses the NFS protocol which is Pay for what you use(no pre-provisioning required). It can scale upto petabytes. Elastic which can grown and shrink whenever needed.

6. AWS Shared Responsibility Model (Security + Compliance) Which security is AWS responsible and which is of customer/user
~ Customer => Customer Data, Platform, Applications, Identity and access management, Operating System, Network & Firewall Confi, Client side data encryption and data integroty authentication, server-side encrypton, networking traffic protection
~ AWS =>Software, compute, storage, database, networking, HW/AWS Global infra, Regions, AZ, Edge locations

7. AWS Security
~ Artifact (Compliance related reports) => Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related info. It provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements. 
~ GuardDuty (Threat detection and security monitoring) => Offers threat detection and continuous security monitoring for malicious or unauthorized behavior to help protect AWS accounts and workloads
~ WAF (Firewall) => Web application firewall protects against common exploits that compromise app availability, security or excessive resource consumption
~ Shield(Protects DDoS) => Shield is a managed Distributed DDoD protection service
~ KMS (symmetric/asymmetric encryption key)=> Key management service gives you centralized control over the encryption keys used to protect your data. 
~ CloudHSM => Cloud-based hardware security module that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud
~ Certificate Manager => Provides you with SSL/TLS certificates for use.
~ Inspector(Security assessment service) => Automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of app deployed on AWS
~ Trust Advisor(advisor for cost optimization, performance, security and fault tolerance)
~ Penetration testing => Penetration testing is the practice of testing one's own app security for vulnerabilities by simulating an attack
~ SSO Single Sign-On => It is a cloud-based single sign-on service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to all your AWS accounts and cloud apps.
~ Cognito (User sign-up/sign-in) => Allows to add user sign-up, sign-in and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily.

8. AWS Networking Services
~ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) => A Virtual Private cloud is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. VPC spans all the availability zones in the region. By default you can create up to 5 VPCs per region.
~ Subnet => A segment of a VPC's IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources
~ Internet Gateway => Amazon VPC side of a connection to the public internet
~ NAT Instance => Managed by software updates, Scale up manually, No high availability, need security group, can use as bastion host
~ NAT Gateway => Managed by AWS, Elastic scalability upto 45 Gbps, provides automatic high availability within an AZ and can be placed in multiple AZs, no security groups, can't access through SSH
~ Direct Connect (DX) => It is a network service that provides an alternative to using the internet to connect a customer's on-premises sites to AWS.
~ Global accelerator => It is a service that improves the availability and performance of apps with local or global users.
~ AWS Outposts => It is a service that offers the same AWS infra, services, APIs and tools to virtually any datacenter, co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience. Outposts is available as a 42U rack that can scale from 1 rack to 96 racks to create pools of compute and storage capacity
Outposts is ideal for workloads that require low latency access to on-premises systems, local data processing, data residency and migration of apps with local system interdependencies.

9. Identity and Access management (authorized signin-signout)
~ AWS Identity and access management is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources
~ IAM can be use to manage users, groups, access policies, roles, user crendentials, user password policies, multi-factor authentication, API keys for programmatic access
~ IAM Users => An IAM user is an entity that represents a person or service who has been granted access to the service
~ Groups => Groups are collections of users and have policies attached to them. A group is not an identity and cannot be identified as a principal in an IAM policy.
~ Roles => Roles are set of permissions for making AWS service requests
~ Policies => Policies are documents that define permissions and can be applied to users, groups and roles
~ STS => Security token service is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for IAM users or for users that you authenticate

10. Global Infra
~ Regions
~ Availability Zones 
~ Local Zones
~ AWS Wavelength
~ AWS Outposts
~ Edge locations and regional edge caches
